#Bike Geolocation Project. 

I've had several bike's stolen even with kryptonite locks. My current e-bike (Juiced Rip Current S) has a large battery and controller. None of the tracking devices on the market seemed to have the security features I was looking for. 

Ambitious as it is I'm working on integrating a security system into the bike using the Arduino MKR GSM 1400 and several other modules. 

Basically I want this security system to do several things. 
-   detect motion or movement when in a locked state and send an alert
-   prevent the ebike from powering on before using an NFC/RFID fab 
-   trigger an alarm if the bike is moving and unlocked
-   Since someone can still pedal the bike track the bikes location
-   The arduinio will use its own battery but ideally only as a backup battery incase someone removes or disables the built in battery,
